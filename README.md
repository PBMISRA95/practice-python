This repository is also my first repository that I am working on.

Date - 23/07/2020

1. I code all programs in Visual Code. Here the code for the questions from practicepython.org is written in this repository.
2. Upload it to this repository on Github to practice on how to code and also learn about version control.
3. I would also coordinate this with Trello Board.

4. More updates to follow soon
